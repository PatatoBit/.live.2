				Hello, I'm Pat, I'm a student from Thailand and is currently coding for hobby by making fun projects.
				I've been coding since I was about 11. 
				Being inspired by Dani who is a game developer.So I wrote my first line of code in C# for Unity.
				Then I got bored because it requires a bit of calculating and maths. So I switched to web development until now.

				I can speak Thai, English, a bit Chinese. And I'm currently trying to learn Dutch.
				Why? You might ask. The Netherlands is the country that I wanted to live in the most.
				For a long time, I've been wanting to leave Thailand. For multiple reasons that I won't talk about.
